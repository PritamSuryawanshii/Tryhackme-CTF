## ✨ About This Archive

Welcome to my TryHackMe CTF walkthrough archive! 🛠️  
This repository documents my journey as I sharpen my skills in **penetration testing**, **vulnerability assessment**, and **post-exploitation techniques** through hands-on CTFs.

Each room includes:

- 📝 Short writeups (no spoilers)
- 🧩 Techniques used (Recon, Enumeration, Exploitation, PrivEsc)
- 📸 Screenshots where applicable
- 🚩 Captured Flags
